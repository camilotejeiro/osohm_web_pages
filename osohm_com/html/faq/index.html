						Frequently Asked Questions
					</h4>
					<p class="faq-section-disclaimer"> 
						Please note, these answers reflect only our views 
						and are not in reference to any specific 
						organization or social movement in particular.

					<ol>
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-1">What is open technology?</li> 
						In broad terms, open technology means you 
						have access to the underlying intellectual 
						property that makes the technology and applications 
						you use possible. You have access to inspect, 
						understand, modify, use and build upon the open 
						technology to fit your purposes.    
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>From a software standpoint:</b> open software means 
								you have access to the human-readable source code 
								which you can then use to build the 
								executable(binary) copies of the 
								programs/applications you use. You can 
								use these programs much like you use 
								any other proprietary program, however 
								the real value is that you or anyone can open, 
								learn and modify the code such that 
								it can be improved and/or adapted to meet 
								your needs. (e.g. removing or adding 
								features, but also having transparency 
								with privacy and security concerns)
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>From a hardware standpoint:</b> open hardware means 
								you have access to the necessary design 
								files (electrical, mechanical, industrial 
								...etc ) 
								which are used to mass manufacture 
								multiple copies of the products you 
								use everyday. These design files can 
								be openned and modified such that products 
								are designed to last (there is no 
								economic incentive for guided obsolence). 
								Furthermore existent hardware can be 
								adapted to meet new needs or satisfy new 
								markets without the necessity of costly 
								and wasteful re-designs due to 
								proprietary(patented) technology.
							</li>
						</ul> 
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-2">What is closed/proprietary technology?</li>
						Closed and proprietary technology means the 
						intellectual property underlying the products 
						and services you use is completely hidden 
						and inaccesible to you. You are granted limited 
						permission to use the copies you purchase. 
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>From a software standpoint:</b> proprietary
								software means you do not have access 
								to human-readable source code, 
								it is used to generate the executable(binary) 
								copies which you can then purchase(license) 
								and use for a certain time under the 
								applicable legal condittions (see EULA, 
								Terms of Service).
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>From a hardware standpoint:</b> proprietary 
								hardware means you do not have 
								access to product design files. 
								These are used to manufacture identical 
								copies of consumer goods which you 
								can then purchase. These products are 
								normally shipped with terms and condittions 
								which grant you certain rights to use 
								the product but forbid you from opening, 
								or reverse engineering the underlying 
								hardware.
							</li>
						</ul> 
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-3">What is wrong with proprietary technology?</li>
						<p class="faq-section-quote">
							<q>	Blind dependence on technology and continuous 
								exposure to manipulative marketing leads 
								to misjudgement and unhealthy consumption 
								habits.
							</q>
						</p>
						
						<p>
						It is important to realize that free markets 
						fail when consumers have innacurate and 
						incomplete information about the items they 
						are purchasing. It is only when both sides 
						(consumers and suppliers) have the information 
						they need that you can have a fair negotation 
						and an efficient and equitable outcome. 
						</p>
						
						<p>			
						The problem we face as consumers is that there is 
						an economic incentive for suppliers to hide 
						information that could help us understand the 
						real value of the goods we use.
						</p>
						<p>
						In fact, it is often far easier and more profitable 
						to manipulate the perceived value of a product through 
						good (yet sometimes dishonest) advertising campaigns 
						than it is to invest to improve it. Often 
						a harmful illusion of <q>technology as magic</q> 
						is sold to consumers, and thus our consumption judgement 
						is greatly impaired. We are no longer investing in 
						the real and honest technology we need, but in 
						the next magic show in town, this is not sustainable.
						</p>
						<p>
						
						When we base our consumption decisions on inaccurate 
						or misleading information: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>We lose our freedom of choice.</b> 
								We are told what we need and we continuously 
								overspend to purchase items we don't really 
								need.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>We lose our savings</b> 
								Our continuous overspending makes saving 
								for our future impossible and makes us 
								specially vulnerable to the use of credit.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>We hurt the environment.</b> Though high demand 
								is great for businessess, overutilization 
								depletes the environment natural resources. 
								We are manufacturing items we don't need which 
								quickly end up in our landfills.
							</li>	
							<li> 
								<b>We are often overcharged.</b> Because we have 
								no knowledge of the value of the technology 
								we use, we are often sold overcharged 
								products with nice looking cases.
							</li>
							<li> 
								<b>We give away our privacy.</b> 
								Because we have no knowledge of the 
								actual engineering behind the products we 
								use, companies add functionality to 
								learn of the places we frequent, track the 
								websites we visit and monitor our behavior and
								consumption choices. This data might 
								then be sold to advertising agencies or 
								given to government institutions. 
							</li>
							<li> 
								<b>We are constantly buying upgrades. </b> 
								Our technology suddenly becomes obsolete 
								and we are encouraged (and sometimes coerced) 
								to dispose of our existing functional technology 
								to purchase the new and upgraded.  
							</li>	
							<li> 
								<b>We are told we don't need to learn 
								<q>new is always best</q></b>
								Advertisers can teach us everything we 
								need to know to reap the benefits of 
								technology. 
								The good news is we don't need to think 
								about the science and engineering behind 
								it (that takes effort). The bad news is that 
								advertisers don't need to either. 
							</li>																			
						</ul>
						<p>	
							On the other hand, technology suppliers understand 
							the value of accurate and complete 
							information. Intellectual property is a highly 
							valuable asset protected through property rights 
							and legal non-disclosure agreements. It allows 
							managers to enforce good judgement when allocating 
							their capital to maximize returns.

							They protect their valuable intellectual property. 
							Legal non-disclosure agreements are used to 
							keep company technical information confidential 
							and patents are used to discourage other 
							firms from entering their sector.
						 
							They keep a close watch on their spending.  
							They only invest in technologies that have 
							the potential to increase their future revenue. 
														
							They advertise greater value.
							They employ large advertisement teams to manage 
							their brands and enhance the value of their 
							products in the consumer's mind.
							
							In the end, companies benefit from keeping 
							their technologies closed. They have more 
							control over consumers who are taught to be 
							in demand and willing to pay up for new fashionable 
							products.
						</p>
						<p>
							Engineers also partially benefit from proprietary technology. 
							As professionals, they have access to better job prospects 
							and higher wages. However, as consumers they are 
							subject to the same problems mentioned above. 
							Engineers must have access to the source 
							if they are to protect their own rights 
							and that of other users.
						</p>
						
						 
						Unfortunately, 
						
						as long as proprietary technology 
						continues to be the standard for the development 
						of consumer products, large technology companies 
						will have an unfair advantage over uninformed 
						and/or misled consumers. 
						What we have is a recipe for inequality, a system 
						where the technical knowledge and power resides 
						in the hands of a few and as the knowledge gap 
						continues to increase, so 
						
						
						sustainable and efficient economic 
						outcome is not possible as long as proprietary 
						technology grants an unfair advantage to the suppliers 
						of technology, leaving consumers   
						
						
						built when one party has an unfair advantage 
						over  
						
						
						But unfortunately, we have a recipe for inequality, 
						a system where technical knowledge and power resides 
						in the hands of a few and as the gap increases 
						so does income inequality.

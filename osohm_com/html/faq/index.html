						Frequently Asked Questions

					<p class="faq-section-disclaimer"> 
						Please note, these answers reflect only our views

						organization or social movement in particular.

					<ol>
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-1">What is open technology?</li> 
						In broad terms, open technology means you 
						have access to the underlying intellectual 
						property that makes the technology and applications 
						you use possible. You have access to inspect, 
						understand, modify, use and build upon the open 
						technology to fit your purposes.    
						<ul>
							<li>
								From a software standpoint: open software means 
								you have access to the human-readable source code 
								which you can then use to build the 
								executable(binary) copies of the 
								programs/applications you use. You can 
								use these programs much like you use 
								any other proprietary program, however 
								the real value is that you or anyone can open, 
								learn and modify the code such that 
								it can be improved and/or adapted to meet 
								your needs. (e.g. removing or adding 
								features, but also having transparency 
								with privacy and security concerns)
							</li>

							<li>
								From a hardware standpoint: open hardware means 
								you have access to the necessary design 
								files (electrical, mechanical, industrial 
								...etc ) 
								which are used to mass manufacture 
								multiple copies of the products you 
								use everyday. These design files can 
								be openned and modified such that products 
								are designed to last (there is no 
								economic incentive for guided obsolence). 
								Furthermore existent hardware can be 
								adapted to meet new needs or satisfy new 
								markets without the necessity of costly 
								and wasteful re-designs due to 
								proprietary(patented) technology.
							</li>
						</ul> 
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-2">What is closed/proprietary technology?</li>
						Closed and proprietary technology means the 
						intellectual property underlying the products 
						and services you use is completely hidden 
						and inaccesible to you. You are granted limited 
						permission to use the copies you purchase. 
						<ul>
							<li>
								From a software standpoint: proprietary
								software means you do not have access 
								to human-readable source code, 
								it is used to generate the executable(binary) 
								copies which you can then purchase(license) 
								and use for a certain time under the 
								applicable legal condittions (see EULA, 
								Terms of Service).
							</li>

							<li>
								From a hardware standpoint: proprietary 
								hardware means you do not have 
								access to product design files. 
								These are used to manufacture identical 
								copies of consumer goods which you 
								can then purchase. These products are 
								normally shipped with terms and condittions 
								which grant you certain rights to use 
								the product but forbid you from opening, 
								or reverse engineering the underlying 
								hardware.
							</li>
						</ul> 
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-3">What is wrong with proprietary technology?</li>
						<q class="faq-section-quote">
							Blind dependence on technology and continuous 
							exposure to manipulative marketing leads 
							to misjudgement and unhealthy consumption 
							habits.
						</q>
						<p>
						It is important to realize that free markets 
						fail when consumers have innacurate and 
						incomplete information about the items they 
						are purchasing. It is only when both sides 
						(consumers and suppliers) have the information 
						they need that you can have a fair negotation 
						and an efficient and equitable outcome. 
						</p>
						
						<p>			
						The problem we face as consumers is that there is 
						an economic incentive for suppliers to hide 
						information that could help us understand the 
						real value of the goods we use.
						</p>
						<p>
						In fact, It is often far easier and more profitable 
						to manipulate the perceived value of a product through 
						good (yet sometimes dishonest) advertising campaigns 
						than it is to invest to improve it. Often 
						a harmful illusion of <q>technology as magic</q> 
						is sold to consumers, and thus our consumption judgement 
						is greatly impaired. We are no longer investing in 
						the real and honest technology we need, but in 
						the next magic show in town, this is not sustainable.
						</p>
						<p>
						
						When we base our consumption decisions on innacurate 
						or misleading information, we are meant to make mistakes: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								We loose our freedom of choice: We are told 
								what we need and we continuously overspend 
								to purchase items we don't really 
								need, sometimes we use credit.
							</li>
							<li>
								We are meant to be poor: Our continuous 
								overspending makes saving for our 
								future impossible and makes us specially 
								vulnerable to the use of credit to cover 
								our expenses. 
								our lack of funds and recurring interest 
								charges erode our finances.
							</li>
							<li>
								We hurt the environment: Though high demand 
								is great for businessess, natural resources 
								are constantly wasted, they are overutilized 
								to manufacture items we don't need which 
								quickly end up in our landfills.
							</li>	
							<li> 
								We are often overcharged: Because we have 
								no knowledge of the value of the technology 
								we use, we are often sold overcharged 
								copies with nice looking cases for our 
								products.
							</li>
							<li> 
								We might be giving away our privacy: 
								Because we have no knowledge of the 
								actual engineering behind the products we 
								use, companies might add functionality to 
								know the places we frequent, track the websites 
								we visit and learn about our behavior 
								and consumption choices. This data might 
								then be sold to advertising agencies or 
								given to government institutions.  You might 
								never know about it until you read the legal 
								contract that came with the product.
							</li>
							<li> 
								Our technology becomes obsolete, fast: We are 
								taught that technology changes fast and 
								we are encouraged (and sometimes coerced) 
								to dispose of our old functional technology 
								to purchase the new, but often unnecessary.  
							</li>	
							<li> 
								We give up trying to understand technology:
								We are told we do not need to understand,
								Advertisers teach us everything we 
								need to know to reap the benefits of 
								technology; new is always best. 
								The good news is you don't need to worry 
								about the science and engineering behind 
								it (that takes effort). The bad news is that 
								advertisers don't need either. 
							</li>																			
						</ul>
						<p>
						But proprietary technology does benefit a few. 
						Intellectual property becomes power, and companies 
						guard this knowledge as their most precious asset. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
						They keep a close watch on their spending and 
						invest only on the technology they need (in 
						fact their jobs largely depend on minimizing costs). 
						They also enhance the <q>value</q> of their products 
						both by employing large advertisement teams and 
						by protecting their intellectual property with 
						patents. But at the end it pays well, consumers are 
						taught to be in demand and are willing to pay up 
						for the new incoming technology, sales are good 
						and the investors benefit from the increase in 
						company profits.
						</p>
						<p>
						Engineers and STEM professionals also benefit. 
						They have access to better job prospects 
						and higher wages, plus they are also more aware 
						of the value of technology so they are less easily 
						persuaded by advetisements. But engineers are also 
						consumers and they must have acess to the source 
						and the designs if they are to protect their privacy 
						and their own interests (reading binary is not specially 
						instructive).
						</p>
						But unfortunately, we have a recipe for inequality, 
						a system where technical knowledge and power resides 
						in the hands of a few and as the gap increases 
						so does income inequality.

							<li class="faq-section-li">What is open technology?</li> 
							In broad terms, "open" means you 
							have access to the underlying intellectual 
							property that makes technology and its applications 
							possible.
							<ul>
								<li>
									From a software standpoint: open software means 
									you have access to the human-readable source code 
									which is used to build the executable(binary) copies 
									of the programs/applications you use.
								</li>

								<li>
									From a hardware standpoint: open hardware means 
									you have access to the necessary design 
									files (electrical, mechanical, industrial 
									...etc ) 
									which are used to mass manufacture 
									multiple copies of the products you 
									use everyday. 
								</li>
								
								<li>
									From a research standpoint: open research means 
									you have unrestricted access to unbiased 
									scientific knowledge. 
									The knowledge that makes advances in technology 
									possible, and the results that individuals, communities 
									and governments can rely on to make better, more informed 
									decisions.
								</li>
							</ul> 
							<li class="faq-section-li">What is closed/proprietary Technology?</li>
							Closed and proprietary means you don't have 
							access to the intellectual property used for 
							developing the technology and applications 
							you use. You are granted limited permission 
							to use the copies you purchase. 
							<ul>
								<li>
									From a software standpoint: proprietary
									software means you don't have access 
									to human-readable source code, 
									it is used to generate the executable(binary) 
									copies which you can then purchase(license) 
									and use for a certain time under the 
									applicable legal condittions (see EULA, 
									Terms of Service).
								</li>

								<li>
									From a hardware standpoint: proprietary 
									hardware means you have don't have 
									access to product design files. 
									These are used to manufacture identical 
									copies of consumer goods which you 
									can then purchase, these products are 
									normally shipped with terms and condittions 
									which grant you certain rights to use 
									the product but forbid you from opening, 
									or reverse engineering the underlying 
									hardware.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									From a research standpoint: proprietary 
									research means that relevant scientific 
									information resides in the hands of 
									a few. 
									Projects are funded and completed 
									and research papers are submitted for 
									review and distribution to major research 
									journals.  
									
									those that can afford to fund 
									technology research and those 
									that pay subscriptions to major research 
									journals to access copies .
									This Advances in technology are heavily dependent 
									
									
									You have access to 
									Often, you have access to scientific 
									information on a need to know basis. 
									
									 
									   
									
									 resides in the hand of 
									a few, 
									which 
									open research means 
									you have access to unbiased scientific knowledge. 
									The knowledge that makes advances in technology 
									possible, and the results that individuals, communities 
									and governments can rely on to make better, more informed 
									decisions.

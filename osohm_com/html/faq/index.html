						Frequently Asked Questions

					<p class="faq-section-disclaimer">

						organization or social movement in particular.

					<ol>
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-1">What is open technology?</li> 
						In broad terms, open technology means you 
						have access to the underlying intellectual 
						property that makes the technology and applications 
						you use possible. You have access to inspect, 
						understand, modify, use and build upon the open 
						technology to fit your purposes.    
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>From a software standpoint:</b> open software means 
								you have access to the human-readable source code 
								which you can then use to build the 
								executable(binary) copies of the 
								programs/applications you use. You can 
								use these programs much like you use 
								any other proprietary program, however 
								the real value is that you or anyone can open, 
								learn and modify the code such that 
								it can be improved and/or adapted to meet 
								your needs. (e.g. removing or adding 
								features, but also having transparency 
								with privacy and security concerns)
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>From a hardware standpoint:</b> open hardware means 
								you have access to the necessary design 
								files (electrical, mechanical, industrial 
								...etc ) 
								which are used to mass manufacture 
								multiple copies of the products you 
								use everyday. These design files can 
								be openned and modified such that products 
								are designed to last (there is no 
								economic incentive for guided obsolence). 
								Furthermore existent hardware can be 
								adapted to meet new needs or satisfy new 
								markets without the necessity of costly 
								and wasteful re-designs due to 
								proprietary(patented) technology.
							</li>
						</ul> 
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-2">What is closed/proprietary technology?</li>
						Closed and proprietary technology means the 
						intellectual property underlying the products 
						and services you use is completely hidden 
						and inaccesible to you. You are granted limited 
						permission to use the copies you purchase. 
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>From a software standpoint:</b> proprietary
								software means you do not have access 
								to human-readable source code, 
								it is used to generate the executable(binary) 
								copies which you can then purchase(license) 
								and use for a certain time under the 
								applicable legal condittions (see EULA, 
								Terms of Service).
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>From a hardware standpoint:</b> proprietary 
								hardware means you do not have 
								access to product design files. 
								These are used to manufacture identical 
								copies of consumer goods which you 
								can then purchase. These products are 
								normally shipped with terms and condittions 
								which grant you certain rights to use 
								the product but forbid you from opening, 
								or reverse engineering the underlying 
								hardware.
							</li>
						</ul> 
						<li class="faq-section-li" id="faq-3">What is wrong with proprietary technology?</li>
						<p class="faq-section-quote">
							<q>	Blind dependence on technology and continuous 
								exposure to manipulative marketing leads 
								to misjudgement and unhealthy consumption 
								habits.
							</q>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							It is important to realize that free markets 
							fail when consumers have innacurate and 
							incomplete information about the items they 
							are purchasing. It is only when both sides 
							(consumers and suppliers) have the information 
							they need that you can have a fair negotation 
							and an efficient and equitable outcome. 
						</p>
						
						<p>			
							The problem we face as consumers is that there is 
							an economic incentive for suppliers to hide 
							information that could help us understand the 
							real value of the goods we use.
						</p>
						<p>
							In fact, it is often far easier and more profitable 
							to manipulate the perceived value of a product through 
							good (yet sometimes dishonest) advertising campaigns 
							than it is to invest to improve it. Often 
							a harmful illusion of <q>technology as magic</q> 
							is sold to consumers, and thus our consumption judgement 
							is greatly impaired. We are no longer investing in 
							the real and honest technology we need, but in 
							the next magic show in town, this is not sustainable.
						</p>
						<p>
						
						When we base our consumption decisions on inaccurate 
						or misleading information: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>We lose our freedom of choice.</b> 
								We are told what we need and we continuously 
								overspend to purchase items we don't really 
								need.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>We lose our savings.</b> 
								Our continuous overspending makes saving 
								for our future impossible and makes us 
								specially vulnerable to the use of credit.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>We hurt the environment.</b> Though high demand 
								is great for businessess, overutilization 
								depletes the environment natural resources. 
								Companies are mass manufacturing items we don't 
								need which quickly end up in our landfills.
							</li>	
							<li> 
								<b>We are often overcharged.</b> Because we have 
								no knowledge of the value of the technology 
								we use, we are often sold overcharged 
								products with nice looking cases.
							</li>
							<li> 
								<b>We give away our privacy.</b> 
								Because we have no knowledge of the 
								actual engineering behind the products we 
								use, companies add functionality to 
								learn of the places we frequent, track the 
								websites we visit and monitor our behavior and
								consumption choices. This data is 
								then be sold to advertising agencies or 
								given to government institutions. 
							</li>
							<li> 
								<b>We are constantly buying upgrades. </b> 
								Our technology suddenly becomes obsolete 
								and we are encouraged (and sometimes coerced) 
								to dispose of our existing functional technology 
								to purchase the new and upgraded.  
							</li>	
							<li> 
								<b>We are told we don't need to learn 
								<q>new is always best</q>.</b>
								Advertisers can teach us everything we 
								need to know to reap the benefits of 
								technology. 
								The good news is we don't need to think 
								about the science and engineering behind 
								it (that takes effort). The bad news is that 
								advertisers don't need to either. 
							</li>																			
						</ul>
						<p>	
							However, proprietary technology does benefit a few. 
							Technology suppliers understand that it is not the 
							consumer good that is truly valuable but the 
							intellectual property behind it. Having the 
							underlying design means they are able manufacture 
							distributable copies of a product which they 
							can then sell to consumers. Furthermore, access 
							to technical knowledge means managers have the 
							accurate and complete information they need 
							to better allocate their capital and maximize 
							their returns.
						</p>
						<p>	
							But unfortunately, we have a recipe for inequality.
							As long as proprietary technology continues 
							to be our standard for product development, 
							knowledge will reside in the hands of a few and 
							technology suppliers will have an unfair advantage 
							over uninformed and/or misled consumers.     
						</p> 
						<p>
							<b>Change won't come from suppliers</b>, a growing 
							knowledge gap poses great economic 
							benefits to suppliers and they have large 
							incentives to lobby and perpetuate the system. 
						</p>
						<p>	
							<b>The change must come from us</b>, we must become 
							informed consumers. we should invest directly 
							in the technology we need and shift the value 
							from the fashionable consumer good to the 
							underlying intellectual property. 
						</p>
